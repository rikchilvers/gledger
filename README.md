# gledger

Much like [zledger](https://github.com/rikchilvers/zledger) and [rledger](https://github.com/rikchilvers/rledger), the goal of gledger was to rewrite [ledger](https://github.com/ledger/ledger) in a language I was interested in while adding [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/)-style envelope budgeting.
